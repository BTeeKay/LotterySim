Input numbers and see if you win!

Currently at a stage where a sequence of 6 numbers can be entered one at a time. The code will then generate 6 numbers in the same range and check if any
are in the same location, or in otherwords a winning number.

currently the program will accept numbers between 1 and 3 and will generate the same. This was to make troubleshooting hits easier

I eventually want to make this so you enter 6 numbers, ranging from 1 to 59 (like the UK lotto) and the program will simulate how many times until your numbers match
the results.
