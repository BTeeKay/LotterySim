# LotterySim
Input numbers and see if you win!

This mini project will take 6 numbers inputted by the user and then compare them to 6 randomly generated numbers. It will then repeat the process of randomly generating numbers until they match the numbers entered by the user. Each time a new set of winning numbers are compared against the human input, a counter is incremented. The code then prints how many times the lottery was run before the humanâ€™s numbers were winners.

The code currently has a very long runtime as my solution to duplicate numbers in the random generated numbers triples the steps taken. This becomes a problem when the probability of winning is made the same as real life lotteries.
